# Oil-Spill-Dataset
The data set was developed by starting with satellite images of the ocean,some of which contain an oil spill and some that do not.
There are two classes and the goal is to distinguish between spill and non-spill using the features for a given ocean patch.
Non-Spill: negative case, or majority class.
Oil Spill: positive case, or minority class
There are a total of 50 Columns in the Dataset , the output column is named as target.
Useing the various methods such as Handling null values, One-Hot Encoding, Imputation and Scaling of Data Pre-Processing where necessary.
Derive some insights from the dataset.
Appling various Machine Learning techniques to predict the output in target column, make use of Bagging and Ensemble as required and find the best model by evaluating the model using Model evaluation techniques.
